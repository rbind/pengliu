abstract: Several M CAT elements are present in the chicken nicotinic acetylcholine receptor γ subunit promoter and required for the totipotency of this gene.To understand the binding properties of M CAT element,the interaction of M CAT motif,at the position -67/-61 relative to the initiation site of γ promoter with nuclear proteins,were analyzed.Mutageneses and binding experiments demonstrated that the M CAT core motif bound nuclear protein(s) from tested chicken tissues to generate a high mobility complex;while the flanking sequence bound different factors to generate lower mobility complexes with the exception of liver.Southwestern blotting showed that only a 30 kD protein was expressed in tested tissues of chicken embryo at day 13. These results suggest that a 30 kD factor can directly bind to M CAT element in the manner of monomer,even homodimer and is ubiquitously expressed in tissues,while the binding of the factor(s) to flanking sequence should probably rely on the presence of a 30 kD ubiquitous factor.
