abstract: Translational efficiency change is an important mechanism for regulating protein synthesis. Experiments with paired ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) allow the study of translational efficiency by simultaneously quantifying the abundances of total transcripts and those that are being actively translated. Existing methods for Ribo-seq data analysis either ignore the pairing structure in the experimental design or treat the paired samples as fixed effects instead of random effects. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects model which incorporates a random effect for the paired samples according to the experimental design. We provide an analytical software tool, “riboVI,” that uses a novel variational Bayesian algorithm to fit our model in an efficient way. Simulation studies demonstrate that “riboVI” outperforms existing methods in terms of both ranking differentially translated genes and controlling false discovery rate. We also analyzed data from a real ribosome profiling experiment, which provided new biological insight into virus-host interactions by revealing changes in hormone signaling and regulation of signal transduction not detected by other Ribo-seq data analysis tools.
