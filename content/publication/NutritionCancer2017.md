abstract: Dietary resistant starch (RS) has been suggested to reduce colonic neoplasia. To determine the effects of digestion-resistant cornstarch on colonic carcinogenesis and Wnt signaling in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated F344 rats, diets containing naturally occurring RS from corn lines derived partially from Guat209 (GUAT), AR16035 (AR), or a hybrid (ARxGUAT), containing 34.5 ± 2.0, 0.2 ± 0.1, and 1.9 ± 0.1% RS, respectively, were fed at 55% of the diet. GUAT-fed rats had increased cecal content and tissue weight and decreased cecal pH compared with AR- or ARxGUAT-fed rats. Numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were not different among diet groups. Increased numbers of crypts/focus were observed in AOM-injected rats fed GUAT compared with rats fed other diets. β-catenin mRNA expression of the crypts was significantly increased in GUAT-fed rats injected with AOM relative to those injected with saline. These findings suggest that selected dietary RSs may at some level further enhance colonocyte proliferation and differentiation in an AOM-treated colon.
