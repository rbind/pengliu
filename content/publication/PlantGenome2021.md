abstract: Plant phenotyping under field conditions plays an important role in agricultural research. Efficient and accurate high-throughput phenotyping strategies enable a better connection between genotype and phenotype. Unmanned aerial vehicle-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms (UAV-HTPPs) provide novel opportunities for large-scale proximal measurement of plant traits with high efficiency, high resolution, and low cost. The objective of this study was to use time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from UAV-based multispectral imagery to characterize its pattern across development and conduct genetic dissection of NDVI in a large maize population. The time series NDVI data from the multispectral sensor were obtained at five time points across the growing season for 1,752 diverse maize accessions with a UAV-HTPP. Cluster analysis of the acquired measurements classified 1,752 maize accessions into two groups with distinct NDVI developmental trends. To capture the dynamics underlying these static observations, penalized-splines (P-splines) model was used to obtain genotype-specific curve parameters. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) using static NDVI values and curve parameters as phenotypic traits detected signals significantly associated with the traits. Additionally, GWAS using the projected NDVI values from the P-splines models revealed the dynamic change of genetic effects, indicating the role of geneâ€“environment interplay in controlling NDVI across the growing season. Our results demonstrated the utility of ultra-high spatial resolution multispectral imagery, as that acquired using a UAV-based remote sensing, for genetic dissection of NDVI.
