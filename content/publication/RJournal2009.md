abstract: Microarray experiments are becoming more and more popular and critical in many biological disciplines. As in any statistical experiment, appropriate experimental design is essential for reliable statistical inference, and sample size has a crucial role in experimental design. Because microarray experiments are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate sample size that will achieve a desired power without wasting resources.
