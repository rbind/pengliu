abstract: We propose a procedure for sample size calculation while controlling false discovery rate for RNA-seq experimental design. Our procedure depends on the Voom method proposed for RNA-seq data analysis by Law et al. (2014) <doi:10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29> and the sample size calculation method proposed for microarray experiments by Liu and Hwang (2007) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl664>. We develop a set of functions that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-sample t-test for RNA-seq experiments with fixed or varied set of parameters. The outputs also contain a plot of power versus sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes, and a table of critical test values at different sample sizes. To install this package, please use 'source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); biocLite("ssizeRNA")'.
